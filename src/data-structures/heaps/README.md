### Heap Data Structure

A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

    1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
    2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

#### What is Heapify?

Heapify restores the heap property by rearranging the heap.
